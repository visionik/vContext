    "narratives": {
      "Outcome": "Successfully restored service in 45 minutes with no data loss. Impact: 15% of users experienced degraded performance.",
      "Strengths": "Clear runbook made initial diagnosis fast. Team communication was excellent. Failover process worked as designed.",
      "Weaknesses": "Monitoring didn't catch the disk space issue until after the failure. Manual failover took 20 minutes due to unclear documentation. No automated alerts for disk utilization.",
      "Lessons": "Automate database failover to reduce recovery time. Add canary queries to detect degradation early. Implement disk space alerts at 70% threshold. Update runbook with clearer failover steps."
