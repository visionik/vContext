    "status": "proposed",
    "narratives": {
      "Proposal": "Migrate the REST API to GraphQL to reduce overfetching and improve developer experience.",
      "Background": "Current API has 50+ endpoints with inconsistent patterns. Clients fetch multiple endpoints for single views, causing performance issues.",
      "Problem": "Overfetching wastes bandwidth. Underfetching requires multiple round-trips. API maintenance burden is high.",
      "Constraint": "Must maintain backward compatibility with existing REST clients during migration period.",
      "Alternative": "Could use REST with field filtering (JSON:API or similar), but doesn't solve type safety issues.",
      "Risk": "Learning curve for team unfamiliar with GraphQL. Potential performance issues with N+1 queries if not properly optimized."
