    "narratives": {
      "summary": "RFC 854 defines the TELNET protocol for providing a general, bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility over TCP. Its primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal devices and terminal-oriented processes using a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) abstraction with negotiated options.",
      "problem": "Host terminals have diverse characteristics and handling conventions. Without a standard intermediate representation, each host would need to maintain information about every other host's terminal type, creating an unmanageable combinatorial complexity.",
      "solution": "Define a Network Virtual Terminal (NVT) as an imaginary canonical terminal with standard control codes and display characteristics. All hosts map their local device characteristics to/from the NVT. Option negotiation allows hosts to extend beyond NVT baseline capabilities in a symmetric, non-terminating-loop-safe manner.",
      "scope": "**In scope**: NVT printer/keyboard definition, USASCII control code semantics, TELNET command codes (IAC, WILL, WON'T, DO, DON'T, SE, SB, etc.), option negotiation rules, transmission discipline, SYNCH signal mechanism, connection establishment.\n**Out of scope**: Specific option definitions (covered in companion document \"TELNET Option Specifications\"), TCP implementation details, application-layer protocols above TELNET."
